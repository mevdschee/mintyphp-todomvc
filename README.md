MintyPHP (formerly known as MindaPHP) aims to be a full-stack PHP 7 framework that is:

  - Easy to learn
  - Secure by design
  - Light-weight

By design, it does:

  - … require you to write SQL queries (no ORM).
  - … use PHP as a templating language.

Mainly to make it easy to learn for PHP developers.
